hs.js and Index.html have been uploaded to git
hs.js is my first crack at writing a temperature controlling loop that will turn on and off the out put to the heater
based on a simple test.  Actual temperature vs a setpoint.  The setpoint can be modified with with a simple web interface (index.html).
